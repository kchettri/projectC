 * **********************************************************
 *
 * Implementation based on HDFS's datanode, which does the following:
 *
 * Class: org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.DataNode
 *
 * DataNode is a class (and program) that stores a set of
 * blocks for a DFS deployment.  A single deployment can
 * have one or many DataNodes.  Each DataNode communicates
 * regularly with a single NameNode.  It also communicates
 * with client code and other DataNodes from time to time.
 *
 * DataNodes store a series of named blocks.  The DataNode
 * allows client code to read these blocks, or to write new
 * block data.  The DataNode may also, in response to instructions
 * from its NameNode, delete blocks or copy blocks to/from other
 * DataNodes.
 *
 * The DataNode maintains just one critical table:
 *   block-> stream of bytes (of BLOCK_SIZE or less)
 *
 * This info is stored on a local disk.  The DataNode
 * reports the table's contents to the NameNode upon startup
 * and every so often afterwards.
 *
 * DataNodes spend their lives in an endless loop of asking
 * the NameNode for something to do.  A NameNode cannot connect
 * to a DataNode directly; a NameNode simply returns values from
 * functions invoked by a DataNode.
 *
 * DataNodes maintain an open server socket so that client code
 * or other DataNodes can read/write data.  The host/port for
 * this server is reported to the NameNode, which then sends that
 * information to clients or other DataNodes that might be interested.
 *

 *
 * org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.BPServiceActor
 *
 * Sends the blockreport per namespaceID. First it gets namenode info, eg. namespaceId etc.
